channels_rabbitmq
=================

A Django Channels channel layer that uses RabbitMQ as its backing store.

Installation
------------

``pip install channels_rabbitmq``

Usage
-----

Then set up the channel layer in your Django settings file like so::

    CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
        "default": {
            "BACKEND": "channels_rabbitmq.core.RabbitmqChannelLayer",
            "CONFIG": {
                "host": "amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1/asgi",
                # "ssl_context": ... (optional)
            },
        },
    }

Possible options for ``CONFIG`` are listed below.

``host``
~~~~~~~~

URL of the server to connect to, adhering to `RabbitMQ spec
<https://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html>`_. To connect to a RabbitMQ cluster,
use a DNS server to resolve a hostname to multiple IP addresses.
channels_rabbitmq will automatically reconnect if at least one of them is
reachable in case of a disconnection.

``expiry``
~~~~~~~~~~

Minimum number of seconds a message should wait in a RabbitMQ queue, before it
may be silently dropped.

Defaults to ``60``. You generally shouldn't need to change this, but you may
want to turn it down if you have peaky traffic you wish to drop, or up if you
have peaky traffic you want to backlog until you get to it.

``group_expiry``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Group expiry in seconds. Defaults to ``86400``. Channels will be removed from
the group after this amount of time. It's recommended that you increase this
parameter to ``86400000`` (1 year) and rely on explicit ``group_discard()`` to
cancel subscriptions. (If your process halts, the group membership will
disappear from RabbitMQ immediately: you needn't worry about leaks.)

``local_capacity``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of messages queued in memory. Defaults to ``100``. (A message sent to
a group with two channels counts as two messages.) When ``local_capacity``
messages are queued, the message backlog will grow on RabbitMQ.

``local_expiry``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minimum number of seconds a message received from RabbitMQ must be held in
memory waiting for ``receive()``, before it may be dropped. Defaults to
``expiry``.

A warning will be logged when a message expires locally. The warning can
indicate that a channel has more messages than it can handle; or that
messages are being sent to a channel that does not exist. (Perhaps a missing
channel was implied by ``group_add()``, and a matching ``group_discard()``
was never called.)

``remote_capacity``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of messages stored on RabbitMQ for each client. Defaults to ``100``.
(A message sent to a group with three channels on two distinct clients counts
as two messages.) When ``remote_capacity`` messages are queued in RabbitMQ,
the channel will refuse new messages. Calls from any client to ``send()`` or
``group_send()`` to the at-capacity client will raise ``ChannelFull``.

``prefetch_count``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of messages to read from RabbitMQ at a time. Defaults to ``10``. This
makes ``local_capacity`` a bit of a "loose" setting: if messages are queued
rapidly enough, the client may request ``prefetch_count`` messages even if it
already has ``local_capacity - 1`` messages in memory. Higher settings
accelerate throughput a little bit; lower settings help adhere to
``local_capacity`` more rigorously.

``ssl_context``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An `SSL context
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl-contexts>`_. Changes the
default ``host`` port to 5671 (instead of 5672).

For instance, to connect to an TLS RabbitMQ service that will verify your
client::

    import ssl
    ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context(
        cafile=str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'ssl' / 'server.cert'),
    )
    ssl_context.load_cert_chain(
        certfile=str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'ssl' / 'client.certchain'),
        keyfile=str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'ssl' / 'client.key'),
    )
    CHANNEL_LAYERS['default']['CONFIG']['ssl_context'] = ssl_context

By default, there is no SSL context; all messages (and passwords) are
are transmitted in cleartext.

``groups_exchange``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Global direct exchange name used by channels to exchange group messages.
Defaults to ``"groups"``. See also `Design decisions`_.

Design decisions
----------------

To scale enormously, this layer only creates one RabbitMQ queue per instance.
That means one web server gets one RabbitMQ queue, no matter how many
websocket connections are open. For each message being sent, the client-side
layer determines the RabbitMQ queue name and uses it as the routing key.

Groups are implemented using a single, global RabbitMQ direct exchange called
"groups" by default. To send a message to a group, the layer sends the message to the
"groups" exchange with the group name as the routing key. The client binds and
unbinds during ``group_add()`` and ``group_remove()`` to ensure messages for
any of its groups will reach it. See also the `groups_exchange`_ option.

RabbitMQ queues are ``exclusive``: when a client disconnects (through close or
crash), RabbitMQ will delete the queue and unbind the groups.

Django Channels' specification does not account for "connecting" and
"disconnecting", so this layer is always connected. It will reconnect forever
in the event loop's background, logging warnings each time the connect fails.

Once a connection has been created, it pollutes the event loop so that
``async_to_sync()`` will destroy the connection if it was created within
``async_to_sync()``. Each connection starts a background async loop that pulls
messages from RabbitMQ and routes them to receiver queues; each ``receive()``
queries receiver queues. Empty queues are deleted. TODO delete queues that
only contain expired messages, so we don't leak when sending to dead channels.

Dependencies
------------

You'll need Python 3.6+ (lower hasn't been tested) and a RabbitMQ server.

If you have Docker, here's how to start a development server::

    ssl/prepare-certs.sh  # Create SSL certificates used in tests
    docker run --rm -it \
         -p 5671:5671 \
         -p 5672:5672 \
         -p 15672:15672 \
         -v "/$(pwd)"/ssl:/ssl \
         -e RABBITMQ_SSL_CACERTFILE=/ssl/ca.cert \
         -e RABBITMQ_SSL_CERTFILE=/ssl/server.cert \
         -e RABBITMQ_SSL_KEYFILE=/ssl/server.key \
         -e RABBITMQ_SSL_VERIFY=verify_peer \
         -e RABBITMQ_SSL_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT=true \
         rabbitmq:3.7.8-management-alpine

You can access the RabbitMQ management interface at http://localhost:15672.

To add features and fix bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, start a development RabbitMQ server::

    ssl/prepare-certs.sh  # Create SSL certificates used in tests
    docker run --rm -it \
         -p 5671:5671 \
         -p 5672:5672 \
         -p 15672:15672 \
         -v "/$(pwd)"/ssl:/ssl \
         -e RABBITMQ_SSL_CACERTFILE=/ssl/ca.cert \
         -e RABBITMQ_SSL_CERTFILE=/ssl/server.cert \
         -e RABBITMQ_SSL_KEYFILE=/ssl/server.key \
         -e RABBITMQ_SSL_VERIFY=verify_peer \
         -e RABBITMQ_SSL_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT=true \
         rabbitmq:3.7.8-management-alpine

Now take on the development cycle:

#. ``python ./setup.py pytest`` # to ensure tests pass.
#. Write new tests in ``tests/`` and make sure they fail.
#. Write new code in ``channels_rabbitmq/`` to make the tests pass.
#. Submit a pull request.

To deploy
~~~~~~~~~

Use `semver <https://semver.org/>`_.

#. Change ``__version__`` in ``channels_rabbitmq/__init__.py``.
#. Add to ``CHANGELOG.rst``.
#. ``git commit channels_rabbitmq/__init__.py CHANGELOG.rst -m 'vX.X.X'`` but don't push.
#. ``git tag vX.X.X``
#. ``git push --tags && git push``

TravisCI will push to PyPi.
